# Security Policy

## Overview

Casa dos Escritores implements comprehensive security measures to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain platform integrity. This document outlines our security implementation and reporting procedures.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Security Support |
|---------|------------------|
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Full Support  |
| 0.x.x   | ❌ End of Life   |

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Supabase Auth integration
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, user, and guest roles
- **Session Management**: Secure token handling and expiration
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Ready for implementation

### Data Protection
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Database-level access control
- **Input Sanitization**: Server-side validation and sanitization
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries via Supabase
- **XSS Protection**: DOMPurify implementation and CSP headers

### Infrastructure Security
- **Rate Limiting**: Endpoint-specific request throttling
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: TLS 1.3 encryption in transit
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers
- **File Upload Security**: Type validation and size limits

## Security Headers Implementation

```javascript
// Security headers configured in next.config.mjs
{
  "Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
  "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
  "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
  "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
  "Permissions-Policy": "geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()"
}
```

## Rate Limiting Configuration

| Endpoint Type | Requests | Time Window |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Authentication | 5 | 15 minutes |
| File Upload | 10 | 60 minutes |
| API General | 100 | 15 minutes |
| Admin Actions | 20 | 60 minutes |

## File Upload Security

### Allowed File Types
- Images: JPEG, PNG, WebP
- Maximum Size: 5MB
- Validation: MIME type and file extension verification

### Upload Process
1. Authentication verification
2. File type validation
3. Size limit enforcement
4. Malware scanning (planned)
5. Secure storage via Supabase

## Environment Security

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Production Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Configuration Security
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- No hardcoded credentials in source code
- Separate configurations for development/production
- Regular key rotation procedures

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Events Logged
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- Administrative actions
- Rate limit violations
- File upload activities
- Suspicious input patterns

### Log Retention
- Security logs: 90 days
- Application logs: 30 days
- Error logs: 60 days

## Vulnerability Management

### Security Assessment
- **Last Full Audit**: January 2025
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 0 (resolved)
- **Next Scheduled Review**: March 2025

### Resolved Security Issues
1. **Credential Exposure**: Removed hardcoded API keys
2. **Unprotected Admin Endpoints**: Implemented authentication
3. **File Upload Vulnerabilities**: Added comprehensive validation
4. **Missing Security Headers**: Full implementation completed
5. **Rate Limiting**: Applied to all critical endpoints
